# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Dillon Gee

In Zinsser's article, he addresses the issue of clutter in writing and explains 
how simplifying your writing can solve clutter.  Zinsser says that clutter happens 
when writers get lost in their writing and lose their train of thought. 
He states that a writer needs to be thinking clearly to have clear writing. Writers need 
to constantly monitor their writing and make their sentences with simple components. 
He also warns the reader about long words and word clusters. To fix the problem, 
he suggests putting brackets around the useless components in your writing.
